                <h4>Why we recommend adopting ?</h4>
                    <p>There are so many reasons to adopt: meeting a unique pet, spending less, doing a good deed—but let’s talk facts. 
                        Millions of pets enter shelters every year. And hundreds of thousands are euthanized each year. 
                        We don’t tell you that to guilt you or be a downer, but that’s why adoption really matters to us. 
                        So we would love it if you considered adopting. And, since you're here, we’re guessing you are. 
                        Seriously, no judgment if you find a pet another way (every pet parent journey is different!). But we’re here to help make adoption easier, however we can.

                <h4>How to find the perfect pet</h4>
                    <p>Let’s bust a myth. The perfect pet? Doesn’t exist. Because there are so many pets that can be the right fit for you. 
                        It’s just about knowing what you’re looking for. So start by thinking about your criteria based on your lifestyle, 
                        breed preferences, living situation, (fur and human) family, etc. From there, our team can help match you with the right pet. 
                        Check out our New Pet Alerts too: with Alerts, we’ll email you newly added adoptable pets that fit your search—so you can check 
                        out matches and meet your next best friend faster.

            <summary>What is the difference between a shelter and a rescue?</summary>

            <p>Shelters are brick and mortar facilities where homeless pets are cared for while they await adoption. 
                They are public or privately owned and often use words like “humane society” or “SPCA” in their name, 
                although they are all separate independently run organizations and not affiliated with one another. 
                Shelters often allow same day adoptions and have staff, volunteers, and hours of operation when they are open for adopters to meet pets.

            </p>
            
            <p>
            Rescues are privately operated groups that typically rely on volunteers and a network of loving foster homes to board pets while they await adoption, 
            although they may also have a physical facility. They typically hold adoption events at pet stores, parks, and other pet-friendly locations on weekends 
            so adopters can meet pets and inquire about the rescue's adoption process.

            <summary>Do you have adoptable pets in your care</summary>
            <p>No. Pet Adoption Match is not a shelter or rescue and we do not have pets in our care.Our website is an online platform run by a small but mighty
                group of pet lovers who believe life, simply put, is better with pets. We're confident you'll feel the same way when you meet your match, 
                so we build technology to help you do just that.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What is the process to adopt a pet?</summary>
            <p>Every organization's adoption process is different and you will have to inquire with the shelter or rescue, directly, for their adoption process details.</p>
            
            <p>If the pet is with a rescue, they will likely ask you to complete an adoption application, talk with a volunteer who can tell you more about the pet and, 
                if it seems like a good match, they will arrange for a home visit before completing the adoption. Once you pay the adoption fee and your adoption is complete, 
                they will give you vaccination and sterilization records and arrange for your new pet to come home.</p>
                
            <p>If you're adopting from a shelter, you may be able to adopt the same day. If the pet is at a shelter with open hours, you can likely visit the facility to meet the 
                pet, complete any necessary paperwork and pay the adoption fee, and then take your new best friend home to get cozy and settle in.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>How much does it cost to adopt a pet?</summary>
            <p>Adoption fees vary from organization to organization, but typically range from $25 to $125 at shelters and $100 to $300 or more at rescues. 
                Adoption fees help to cover the cost of care for pets in the time leading up to adoption (food, supplies, veterinary care and sterilization, etc.) 
                and rarely even come close to what the shelter or rescue actually spends. You can feel good paying your adoption fee because every adoption fee paid.
                helps another pet in need. That's hero stuff right there!
            </p>
        </details>

        <details>
            <summary>What should I do to prepare to adopt a pet?</summary>
            <p>This is a great question! We know how exciting it is to adopt a pet. We also know it can be a big life change so planning ahead can ensure you're
